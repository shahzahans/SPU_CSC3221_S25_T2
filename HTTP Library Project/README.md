# HTTP Library Project

This project is a full-stack web application that demonstrates the use of HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) using **Node.js (Express)** for the backend and a plain **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** frontend. Users can create, view, update, and delete user information in an in-memory data structure.

## Features

- Fully functional front-end HTTP library (`coreHTTP`) written as a class
- Uses the Fetch API with `async/await` for all requests
- Supports:
  - `GET` for fetching data
  - `POST` for adding data
  - `PUT` for replacing data
  - `PATCH` for partially updating data
  - `DELETE` for removing data
- Built-in error handling for all request types
- Clean, styled UI for testing the library against any route
- Displays both a summary and raw JSON response
