## Task: Contribution to HTTP Project (Phase 1 – Revision and Planning)

### Description 
- Joined the group after initial project development had started.

- Provided her independently completed version of the HTTP project for reference. "https://github.com/jjlavigne/HTTP-Library-Project"

- Shared a detailed project outline and structure that guided the team’s revision efforts.

- Helped the group reassess and refine:

- Route structure for CRUD operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)

- Frontend-to-backend flow using fetch() calls

- Error-handling logic and how it could be implemented more clearly

- Participated in group discussions by reviewing and giving feedback on UI layout and API functionality based on her draft.

- Though not involved in the full original build, her outline and suggestions directly contributed to the restructured group submission.
