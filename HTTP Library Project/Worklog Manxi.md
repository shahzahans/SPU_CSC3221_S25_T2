## Task: Front-end Development

### Description:
	
- Focused on developing the HTML interface to allow users to interact with the custom coreHTTP library.
- Created and styled an input form for specifying API routes and selecting HTTP request types (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE).
- Handled user input for sending POST requests with dummy data to add new users via the UI.
- Structured radio button groups to trigger different request methods, integrating directly with app.js.
- Assisted with response display areas, ensuring that both formatted summaries and raw JSON output are shown clearly.
- Used placeholder API https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users for all request testing â€” no backend server was required.
- Verified all front-end behavior manually, ensuring that Fetch requests handled by the coreHTTP class worked seamlessly with the UI.
