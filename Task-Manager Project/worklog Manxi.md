## Task: Integration & Final QA
### Description

- My role was to make sure the project was fully integrated and everything worked smoothly across the frontend, backend, and database. I tested all CRUD operations from the UI to confirm that tasks were being created, updated, and deleted properly in MongoDB Atlas. I also made sure edge cases like missing task names or invalid inputs were handled correctly.

- I verified that the app displays all tasks when the DELETE option is selected, helping users identify which task they want to remove. I also checked file structure consistency (e.g., moving files to the `public/` folder), ensured server logs were clean, and helped polish UI output formatting for readability. Everything was reviewed and confirmed working before final submission.
