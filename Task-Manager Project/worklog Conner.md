## Task: Frontend, HTML, & script.js
### Description

- I was responsible for designing and implementing the frontend interface using pure HTML and JavaScript. I created the structure of the task manager in `index.html` â€” including labeled inputs for task name, description, due date, and completion checkbox, as well as radio buttons for selecting CRUD operations.

- In `script.js`, I added event listeners to handle user actions and connected them to the appropriate request type using our custom ApiClient. I also added logic so that when the user selects the DELETE option, all existing tasks are automatically displayed, making it easier to identify what to delete. I made sure the UI is functional and responsive across request types, and that it gives clear feedback to the user in the textarea.
  
- Implemented separate `div` sections for each individual task, displaying the task attributes and changing the display of a task if it is completed.

- Leveraged CSS to provide a simple, yet more stylish and organized page design and user interface.
- Incorporated a lavender and beige color palette inspired by Coolors and ColorKit.
