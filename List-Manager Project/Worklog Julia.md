## Task: Building and Testing the Backend (Node.js + Express)

### Description
- Set up an Express server in server.js to serve static files and handle REST API endpoints. Implemented routes for /users, including GET (all and by ID), POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE. Added fs.promises to read and write to data.json. Ensured IDs are dynamically assigned and renumbered after deletes.
