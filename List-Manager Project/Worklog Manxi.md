## Task: Developing script.js â€“ Client-Side Logic

### Description
- Implemented a modular ApiClient class in script.js to handle all fetch requests (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE). Linked form input values to dynamic JSON construction. Added dynamic enabling/disabling of input fields based on the selected method. Connected the "Send Request" button to trigger the appropriate HTTP function.

### Reflection
- This was my first time writing a fetch-based API client from scratch. Learned a lot about dynamic form handling and debugging fetch behavior in the browser.
